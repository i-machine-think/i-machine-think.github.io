  content: "A <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08351.pdf' target='_blank'>preprint</a> of our work on compositionality and neural networks is online! 
  The compositionality of neural networks has been a hot topic recently, on which no consensus exists.
  In this paper, we argue that this in part stems from the fact that there is little consensus on what it means for a network to be compositional, and we present a set of five tests that provide a bridge between the linguistic and philosophical knowledge about compositionality and deep neural networks.
  We use our tests to evaluate a recurrent model, a convolution-based model and a Transformer.
  Curious what we test for? And what we find? Check the <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08351.pdf' target='_blank'>paper</a>, or have a look at this <a href='https://twitter.com/_dieuwke_/status/1164875248283656192?s=20' target='_blank'>twitter thread</a> for the headlines!"
