  description: "Inflectional morphology has since long been a useful testing ground for broader questions about generalisation in language and the viability of neural network models as cognitive models of language. Here, in line with that tradition, we explore how recurrent neural networks acquire the complex German plural system and reflect upon how their strategy compares to human generalisation and rule-based models of this system. We perform analyses including behavioural experiments, diagnostic classification, representation analysis and causal interventions, suggesting that the models rely on features that are also key predictors in rule-based models of German plurals. However, the models also display shortcut learning, which is crucial to overcome in search of more cognitively plausible generalisation behaviour."

  authors: "Dieuwke Hupkes, Verna Dankers, Mathijs Mul and Elia Bruni"
  year: 2020
  image: manifesto_tests.png
  description: "The compositionality of neural networks has been a hot topic recently, on which no consensus exists.
  In this paper, we argue that this in part stems from the fact that there is little consensus on what it means for a network to be compositional, and we present a set of five tests that provide a bridge between the linguistic and philosophical knowledge about compositionality and deep neural networks.
  We use our tests to evaluate a recurrent model, a convolution-based model and a Transformer, and provide an in depth analysis of the results."

  description: "Learning to follow human instructions is a long-pursued goal in artificial intelligence. 
  The task becomes particularly challenging if no prior knowledge of the employed language is assumed. 
 In this paper, we seek to establish whether the right inductive biases can be acquired automatically by a neural network system through a two phase training procedure: A (slow) offline learning stage where the network learns about the general structure of the task and a (fast) online adaptation phase where the network learns the language of a new given speaker."

  description: "While neural network models have been successfully applied to domains that require substantial generalisation skills, recent studies have implied that they struggle when solving the task they are trained on requires inferring its underlying compositional structure. 
  In this paper, we introduce Attentive Guidance, a mechanism to direct a sequence to sequence model equipped with attention to find more compositional solutions. "
