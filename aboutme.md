### [Documentation](https://i-machine-think.github.io/machine/build/html/index.html)

### Introduction
This is a pytorch implementation of a sequence to 
sequence learning toolkit for the i-machine-think 
project. This repository is a fork from the pytorch-seq2seq 
library developed by IBM, but has substantially diverged 
from it after heavy development. For the original implementation, 
visit https://github.com/IBM/pytorch-seq2seq.

### Requirements
This library runs with PyTorch 0.3.0. We refer to the PyTorch website to install the right version for your environment. To install additional requirements (including numpy and torchtext), run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
